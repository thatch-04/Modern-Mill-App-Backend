# Modern Mill Solar App Backend

**Author:** Tim Hatch

## Project Summary
This is the backend API call to the Yelp fusion API for my Modern Mill Solar App. The purpose of the Modern Mill Solar app is to be able to input a keyword and search the Yelp Fusion API for businesses in Naperville, IL related to the searched keyword.

## Technology Used
HTML </br>
CSS </br>
JavaScript </br>
Node.js </br>
React </br>
Express </br>
<br>
</br>

## How to use:

-Pull or clone this repository to your device
-Install dependancies with npm install
-Run your backend server (npm start or nodemon)
-Leave your backend server running to provide the API response to you frontend app.
-Switch to your front end app to perform searches

## Future Improvements:

-Secure API key before hosting backend or using it for production (.env file or other protection method).
-Host backend so you don't need to run locally.
-Currently location is hard-coded since the challenge required the location to be Naperville. Versitility can be added by allowing the user to include a location parameter in the search form in the same way the search term is currently implemented.
